List of classes/objects for the mescaline_svc idea.
SVG holds reference to GraphWindow
GraphWindow holds refs to graphs
Graphs hold refs to GW, TimeBasedDataSet 

First:
  TimeBasedDataSet: A (sort of) set of Key/Values where Key is time.
    This will do all the math on data.  Normalization, calcing min/max for a
    domain 
  Mescaline( logical, not DOM or inheritance) parent of graphGroups.  Dispatches Events (resizeEvent). History of actions, save, auto-add-data settings, themes.
  GraphGroup (holds labels, graphs)  Usually per Unit
    options: force_min, force_max
    Converts "screen locations" to coords useful to Graph/DataSet 
  Graph: A "layer" of data.
    num of lines
    actual line data
    XAxisLabels[]
    YAxisLabels[]
    Key
    Title (for key)
    options
  X/YLabel:
    min,max,offset  


On Graph Add:
  pass data and option set to graph_widow.
    graph window creates new Graph object.  Pass Data to parse.  Possibly 
    trigger a "vertical resize" event.
    check to see if we need to create/update YAxisLabel,XAxisLabel 
    Add this graph's info to the Key

Graph Del:
    check to see if we need to delete YAxisLabel,XAxisLabel,Key 
    del this graph's info from the Key
    Check and fire vertical resize event.
